Goad of the project includes:
1. An app that can tell us whether there is internet available or not
2. If not available then it'd estimate some reasons why it is not available
3. It can notify when target is alive or internet is available
4. GUI should be pleasing and friendly
   ** It's why so charisma has been done on dialog box and automatic retrieval of network settings. Window text-box should be replaced with progress-bar.
